Hi my friends,
I'm learning but I wish to dedicate more time to this
Unfortunately I'm currently also studying Mechanical Engineering at College and that takes all priority
Still I'm happy to be learning

Test test test :)


Cheatsheet
This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)


Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"


Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log


The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.
For example;

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).





_______________________________________
An atomic commit is a commit that includes changes related to only one feature or task of your program. There are two main reasons for doing this: first, if something you change turns out to cause some problems, it is easy to revert the specific change without losing other changes; and second, it enables you to write better commit messages.
